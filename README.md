# User capabilities

This is an attempt to add some kind of fine-grained permissions model to EmonCMS, initially just the groups module.

## Concept

A 'capability' is just the ability to do something.  For example, to be able to create a user in the groups module or to rename a group.  The way it is currently implemented, the ability to use each API endpoint is a capability.

Roles are collections of capabilities, which are then granted to a particular set of users.

If the user has a role which grants them a capability, they can do that thing.  If they aren't, they can't.  For example, if a user has the `groups_view` capability, they can see the groups UI.  If they don't, they can't.

## Status

**Alpha**.  Getting closer to usable but not there yet.  Remaining bugs until first release [tracked here](https://github.com/takkaria/emoncms-user-capabilities/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMVP).  To be genuinely useful, it requires a patched `group` module (which isn't public yet).

## Installation instructions

1. `git clone` into Modules directory
2. Add `const CAPABILITIES_ALWAYS_SUPERUSER = <userid>;` to `settings.php` for whoever your initial 'root' user will be
3. After installing, log in as that user and go to <emoncms url>/user_capabilities
4. You can use it.

## Requirements

The capabilities frontend is written using "modern" JavaScript (ECMAScript 2015) so needs a modern browser (recent Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari will all be fine).

## Future plans

- Set up testing
- Compile down JavaScript into something more browser-friendly
- Figure out how to integrate with emoncms core â€“ ideally replacing the current 'admin' flag on users somehow
