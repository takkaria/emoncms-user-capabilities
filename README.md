# User capabilities

This is an attempt to add some kind of fine-grained permissions model to EmonCMS, initially just the groups module.  Very alpha at the moment.

## Installation instructions

1. `git clone` into Modules directory
2. Add `const CAPABILITIES_ALWAYS_SUPERUSER = <userid>;` to `settings.php` for whoever your initial 'root' user will be
3. After installing, log in as that user and go to <emoncms url>/user_capabilities
4. You can use it.

Looks a bit like this:

## Roadmap

- Get this module working well enough with groups for now (involves thinking through security model of both this + groups + emon core together)
- Set up testing
- Compile down JavaScript into something more browser-friendly
- Figure out how to integrate with emoncms core â€“ ideally replacing the current 'admin' flag on users somehow
